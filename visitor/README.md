# Visitor design pattern
Pattern type: Behavioral

## Definition
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## Details
The Visitor pattern allows tto add a new behavior into a separate class called visitor, instead of trying to integrate it into existing classes. The original object that had to perform the behavior is now passed to one of the visitorâ€™s methods as an argument, providing the method access to all necessary data contained within the object.
